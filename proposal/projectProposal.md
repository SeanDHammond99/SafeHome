###### Project proposal description


SafeHouse is an NFC based security system which allows users to use their Android phone as a key to their front door. The app would allow users to turn NFC cards into keycards for the lock, which allows for much more control and functionality than a conventional keyfob. For example, a user would be able to create keycards that expire, or cards that can deleted. SafeHouse would allow users to unlock the door by using the keycard on the NFC reader on the lock, OR by scanning the card on the phone which then unlocks the door wirelessly. The user would also be able to make them receive an alert when the door is opened, for additional security.

The app is ideal for businesses with many employees to manage grounds access to, or for people who regularly allow people to enter their homes for any reason, for example an AirBnB. The owner of the house would not have to be present when the guests arrive, having already created the keys and left them for the guests to collect, they would not have to be concerned with the loss or destruction of keys, are the cards expire and can be discarded or returned by the guest once their stay is over.

As a stretch goal for the project, users will also be able to use passwords to unlock their door, and would be able to create expiring or single use passwords as well, in the event that a key is lost or stolen, or for the convenience of a user who does not own an NFC enabled device but still wants to open the lock remotely. An additional stretch goal is the restriction of remote unlocking of the door via the app, by using the GPS of the device to determine how close the user is to the door. 



###### Division of Work - Outlines how the work is envisaged to be split equally among the team members.
Android App development - Eamon
Nfc reader 'lock device' - Sean
Web server backend - Eamon & Sean
For the back end, we will probably divide Apis between use for our respective responsibilities and share the code base as a whole.

This is provisional and will change as we come to a better understanding of the challenges facing us


###### Programming language(s) - List the proposed language(s) to be used
React Native (mobile app)
Python (backend & nfc reader)

###### Programming tool(s) - List tools (compiler, database, web server, etc.) to be used
Docker(easy deployment to redbrick), database, web server, python interpreter

###### Learning Challenges - List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn
Android App development, React Native, Docker, NFC, webserver development, setup networking

###### Hardware / software platform - State the hardware and software platform for development, eg. PC, Linux, etc.
Android
Raspberry Pi
Visual Studio Code
intellij
Mac OS
Linux

###### Special hardware / software requirements - Describe any special requirements.
Android phone, NFC readers, Raspberry Pi
